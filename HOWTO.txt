I recommend install Anaconda python distribution first.

Steps to reproduce results:

1. Install pip if you haven't

2. Install required libraries by typing:
for req in $(cat requirements.txt); do pip install $req; done

3. Install PIL (Python Imaging Library) and ipython-qtconsole

4. Start ipython-qtconsole by typing:
ipython qtconsole --pylab=inline

5. run segmentation.py in the qtconsole by typing 'run segmentation'
